# scripts-styles
My created UserScripts and UserStyles for various websites.

## Installing Styles

First, install a browser extension that handles userstyles. I recommend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).

### (Recommended) Install via userstyles.world
My styles are officially published on a dedicated user style site, [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/). You can find my styles [here](https://userstyles.world/user/chev2).

Click on a style you're interested on, then click 'install', and Stylus will bring up a prompt asking if you'd like to install the style.

### Install via GitHub
In this GitHub repo, all of my userstyles are in the `styles/` directory. Navigate there, click on one of the CSS styles, and then click the 'raw' button to install the style.

If done correctly, you should get a prompt from Stylus asking if you'd like to install the style.

## Installing Scripts

First, install a browser extension that handles userscripts. I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

### Install via GitHub
Right now, I only officially host my userscripts on GitHub.

Installation is basically the same as installing userstyles via GitHub, navigating to the `scripts/` directory instead.

If done correctly, you should get a prompt from Tampermonkey asking if you'd like to install the script.
